		<p>This project was created for a data visualization course. The idea was to create a visualization of the cholera outbreak in 19th century London by recreating and building upon John Snow's map of the outbreak</a>.
		Line segments that make up the map of the general area, locations of pumps, deaths and relevant information (location, day, gender, age), and an estimated population age distribution in the setting were given. Some additional points of interest (street names, work house, brewery) were located from John Snow's map itself.
		<br>
		<br>
		Functionalities of the visual:<br><br>
		-Hover over the bars on the timeline to view deaths up until the specified date.<br>
		-Click on a bar on the timeline to specify the start date from which you want to view deaths.<br>
		-Click on the "Cluster View" button to display a grid showing how many deaths in the specified range there are for each cell.<br>
		-Click the (+) and (-) buttons to adjust the number of cells.<br>
		-Drag and scroll on the map to pan and zoom.<br>
		-View the charts on the bottom for information regarding the distribution of ages and genders.
